			<p id="pborder2">Did you know that everything we have is a gift from god, and actually belongs to God?
			The word of God teaches us that many things are a gift from god.  Our life, our freedom, our intellect,
			our ability to worship him - and even our children - or our future children!

		<div class="column">
			<p id="pborder1">That's right. Even the money we earn belongs to him, and we should use it to bring Glory to him.
			Money is a complicated issue.  Sometimes we aren't sure how we should save it, sometimes we aren't sure
			how we should spend it, and sometimes it becomes a problem for us!</p>
